adv
开头可以这样拖延几秒让自己思考，well...that s hard..i guess maybe..
有思路就不拖延直接说
不喜欢＋原因完成时插入：I really dislike advertising , 
原因I think advertising will affect my mood 
现象举例when I watch  TV series , advertisements /ədˈvɜːtɪsmənt/ is the last thing i want to watch    because I can't wait to know the exciting story , but the ads 缩写的我省 事件will waste my time and then make me irritable =angry!
所以完成时I have also seen many kinds of advertising ,maybe...  the food advertisement is  the only thing I can endure. /ɪnˈdjʊə(r)/.well i am a foodie !
细节随意~

或者can be seen everywhere  
比如有for example, bus stops, subway stations and even school billboards have all kinds of advertisements, some  ads are about fashion clothes ../new sports. and different books maybe

no  i have＋ not ! 介绍自己的习性现在时：In fact, I am a person who is  not easily affected by advertising 
虽然some ads are interesting and attractive..but i usually consider my own financial ability ..if i have money and fortunately ..ad is about sth i need..of course i will buy ~不错完成时√

 , and he doesn't allow me to eat barbecue at home !
when i a m with my friends ,  we   can   choose to go out

/.my mother did not allow me to eat bbq  often since childhood,.so I also think barbecue
比如potatoes are my favorite food , the taste of baked potatoes is very wonderful ..love spicy flavor

虽然题目没有完成时，like与否也可以完成时回答，have done或者have never done
否定：I have never worn special clothes, but I have seen some special clothes such as Han suit, Lolita/ləu'li:tə/, and I think they are very beautiful and lovely.

I did this when I was a child ,I liked to watch cartoons like Disney , so I liked to dress up like characters such as my favorite princess  SNOW WHITE !So at that time I would ask my mom to buy me beautiful dress and shoes , when I went out in a dress I received praise
